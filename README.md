# DataSturcturesWithTests

While attempting to improve my knowledge of computer science fundamentals by solving toy problems I thought it would also be a good opportunity to write some tests using Jest. The clear inputs, outputs and scale of these problems means that they have been a perfect exercise for improving my knowledge of TDD. I've also been able to get some really nice efficiency gains from the tests themselves.
